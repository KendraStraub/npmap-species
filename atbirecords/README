This directory holds ATBI species record files for use with MaxEnt.

A master file (containing all species counts for ATBI at a particular time) 
will be named with the following convention:
   
   ATBI_records_yyyy-mm-dd.csv

This file must have a single header line followed by lines of the form:

   Genus_species, x, y

Once we have this master csv, we run the provided python script (separate.py)
to make individual per-species files.  The script must be run in this directory
like so:

   python separate.py ATBI_records_yyyy-mm-dd.csv

This will create a summary file (ATBI_counts_yyyy-mm-dd.txt) listing the counts
for each species with at least 30 records.  It also creates a directory
called ATBI_files_yyyy-mm-dd that holds individual record files for each species
with at least 30 records.

Master lists received so far:

   ATBI_records_2013-03-15.csv
   Received from Chuck Parker in March 2013.  Contains all species at that time
   with 5 or more records.

   ATBI_records_2013-07-16.csv
   Another list from Chuck with only 30+ species.  According to Chuck, it may
   be missing a few species due to problems with their database.
